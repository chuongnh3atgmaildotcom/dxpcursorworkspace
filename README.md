# Workspace docs

This folder is part of the **multi-root Cursor workspace** for `C:\Source`. It holds shared context so the agent (and developers) can reason across repos.

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** – Overview of repos and how jobs/API calls flow between them. Keep it updated when you change cross-repo behavior.
- **.cursor/rules/** – Cursor rules that apply when the workspace is open (e.g. multi-repo and job-flow awareness).

Open the workspace via **File → Open Workspace from File…** and choose `C:\Source\Source.code-workspace`.
