# Code Citation Format

When citing or referencing code from the codebase, **always use the jumpable snippet format** so the user can click to navigate:

- First line of the code block: `startLine:endLine:relative/path/to/file.ext`
- Followed by the actual code lines

## Rules

- Include enough lines for context (typically 3–8 lines).
- Use the actual file path relative to the workspace root.
- Line numbers must be accurate for the current file contents.
- Use this format for any code block that references a specific location in the repo.

## Example

Format: ```startLine:endLine:relative/path followed by the code block. Example path: `55:58:BuildScripts/Invoke-AutomationAccountDeployment.ps1`
